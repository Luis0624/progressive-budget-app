    Budget Tracker is a simple Progressive Web App app that allows the user to keep track of their deposits and expenses while on the move. A key feature of this app is the use of IndexedDB, which allows for the app to retain its functionality in the case of a network interruption, and seamlessly reconnect to the database when the connection is restored without any loss of data.

    The app is built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose
